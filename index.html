<!-- ABOUT ME -->

<body>
    <section class="about_me">
        <img class="profile_picture" src="images/Photos_of_George/Picture of George at Reading Festival.jpeg" alt="Profile image of George Kerridge">
        <h2 class="about_me_header">Hi, I'm George and this is my website</h2>
        <p id="about_me">
            Hey! I'm George and I am a bassist, producer and all-round creative. 
            I have been performing and studying as a musician for over 10 years 
            and I have also extended avenues of my skill set into software 
            engineering, graphic design, film painting and photography. 
            <br><br>
            I initially started music as a way of expressing myself with friends 
            and filling time while living in Suffolk. Over time this has developed 
            into much much more. As a creative, I now see music and the arts 
            as a language to express myself, open up my perception of the world around me 
            and, most importantly, enjoy an expressive language that can be understood by all.
            <br><br>
            I have been fortunate that my time as a musician on stages, in studios 
            or just in friends' bedrooms, has allowed me to experience the joy that 
            this skill can bring to all. I understand that not all people find enjoyment 
            in the more abstract or controversial styles of creativity, but 
            understanding how music and the arts can allow the everyday person 
            to feel a sense of freedom or connectivity to their surroundings 
            is pivotal in the creation of art.
            <br><br>
            You may not want to become a professional musician - you may just want to meet up with friends, 
            play some covers or share some creative moments - but to me, that is the root of music 
            and all creative avenues and if I can help others experience that, I am achieving 
            what I set out to do with my music career.
            <br><br>
            As I move forward in my career, my goal is to combine my knowledge of music and art, 
            to assist in the creation, education, and exploration of these fields to benefit 
            those around me and invite others into the joy of creativity in its many forms.
            <br><br>
            Keep creating!
            <br>
            George Kerridge
