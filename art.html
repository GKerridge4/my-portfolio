    <p>
        I do not have formal training with a paintbrush, nor academic knowledge of the written word; 
        what I do have is an open mind for creativity and experiences I strive to express through 
        a multitude of creative means.
        <br><br>
        I consider myself a professional in auditory expression due to my years of education, study and 
        experience in music and because of this, I appreciate the myriad of trials and lessons that come 
        with any art form. This is why I do not currently call myself a professional with more physical 
        or literate art forms. This does not mean though, that I do not believe in my other forms of 
        expression and give them equal meaning within my self-expression.
        <br><br>
        To physically represent one's feelings on a canvas, on the page or through the screen is a 
        necessary and fundamental act that any creative will face along their journey. For a long time, 
        I have lacked confidence in these forms of expression as I have feared my lack of 
        professionalism in comparison to my music. 
        <br><br>
        In this space, you will find common threads across all of my artistic outlets.
