        <h2>Live & Studio Performance</h2>
        <p>
            The performance of live music has been at the core of my passion since day one. The ability to express a creative 
            project to a group of listeners creates an everlasting impression on me and I never tire of that feeling. 
            <br><br>
            My approach to a live performance is to recreate the creator's original story, whether that be my own or others. 
            There is a huge amount of thought and emotional energy that goes into the creation of any piece of music and this 
            is why I take it upon myself to best recreate that in my performance. This can be achieved through research into an 
            artist's influences, the history behind their creations and discussing the key motives behind their creative identity. 
            <br><br>
            The bass guitar is my most adaptive and creative instrument to perform live with; due to my years spent exploring 
            the instrument, but this hasn't stopped me from taking hold of other instruments and tools to help bolster the 
            creative live performance. In aid of getting the best performance necessary, I have also performed on guitar, 
            drums, pads, synths, sampling and percussion. When I am entrusted with expressing someone's creative project, 
            I will explore every avenue within my means to best showcase this through performance.
            <br><br>
            Not all performances can have a full orchestra or the original organ you recorded from your local church. 
            For this reason, I have developed my way of utilising - as best as technology can afford - Ableton Live 
            to allow me to use these sounds live. By using a click track I can break down songs into a selection of 
            sound bites that I can trigger freely, without the restrictions of a rigid structure. Because of this, 
            I have opened up the option for more freedom with structural improvisation while still maintaining the 
            original sounds of a recording or the live manipulation of recordings to further the creative freedom 
            in performance.
            <br><br>
            Just like my live performance, my main focus in the studio is to translate the creators' vision into 
            a recorded performance. My primary skill in the studio is, again, the bass guitar, but if I have an 
            idea for other instrumentation that could enhance a song I will aim to express that. 
            <br><br>
            With live & studio performances, I hold no restrictions on genre or style. What I enjoy is 
            helping a creative project come alive through ways of technological translation.

        <h2>Music Production & Mixing</h2>
        <p>
            I started my journey in music production - like most - as a way of noting ideas in a more tangible format. 
            The art (and mathematics) of music production soon became obsessive. With time I was able to teach myself 
            the variety of sounds and techniques that could be harnessed through a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) 
            to expand and enhance my music. During my time at university my production tutor - <i>Simone Tanda</i> - 
            opened the door to a multitude of creative processes that aid in experimentation with production. I was taught 
            the patience of listening and I continue to focus on the details within our day-to-day sonic landscapes. 
            With this collection of practical knowledge and experimental thinking, I have become a diverse and 
            open-minded producer.
            <br><br>
            My main DAW of choice is Ableton Live due to its creative attributes. I also find Ableton a brilliant tool 
            for improvisational production when working closely with artists and makes for a fluid segway into 
            live performance (see 'Live & Studio Performance' for more info). I also have experience using 
            Logic Pro X, Cubase and Pro Tools.
            <br><br>
            Although the majority of my music production has consisted of abstract and more experimental music, 
            I am looking to explore everything from pop to metal. I don't believe a producer's skill set is 
            strictly limited by genre, but more in the workflow and mindset with relation to the artist. 
            Before I begin any project I put a lot of focus on reference material and by doing so, 
            I hope to maintain a common thread of experience through the entirety of a project. 
            For me, I find reference material such as music, paintings, literature, or 
            any other medium pivotal to the success of the project. 
            <br><br>
            As a mixing engineer, I hold similar beliefs to my production techniques. 
            Although the mixing process has less to do with the creative process 
            and more with the finishing touches, I still like to focus on detailed 
            reference material so I can achieve an accurate representation 
            of the final product.
