        <h2>Why coffee?</h2>
        <p>
            My love for coffee began like mosts - kept me awake during my studies!<br><br>
            But my enjoyment for coffee didn't end there. I began my experience with coffee brewing espresso. Fortunately, I have always worked 
            with independent coffee companies which kept me open to a range of different beans from a range of locations and farmers. This fed my 
            curiosity for getting more flavor out of the beans I had been working with and opened up the world of other brewing methods. Coming from 
            an english household I began with a cafetiere (French press) and soon purchased my own V60. And so began my specialty coffee journey.<br><br>
            Since then I have had barista, brewing and sensory training with 
            <a class="para_link" href="https://www.origincoffee.co.uk/" target="_blank">Origin Coffee</a>, 
            <a class="para_link" href="https://www.allpressespresso.com/" target="_blank">Allpress Espresso</a> and 
            <a class="para_link" href="https://sca.coffee/" target="_blank">SCA (Specialist Coffee Association)</a>, and 
            over 3 years onsite barista experience.
