        <h2 class="title">My Educational Style</h2>

        <p class="about_text">
            My educational practice is tailored to each individual's goals, whether they aim for a professional career, a hobby, 
            or emotional well-being. I like to offer both online and in-person lessons (in the Cambridge area), 
            with flexible durations from 30 minutes to 2 hours. My teaching style combines improvisation, exploration, 
            and imitation, fostering creativity and problem-solving through hands-on experience with software such as 
            Ableton Live, Logic Pro, ProTools, and Cubase. My lessons cover music theory, DAW practice, composition, 
            mixing, and mastering, with all materials provided digitally.  
            <br><br>
            I emphasise a supportive and inclusive environment, drawing on my SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities) 
            teaching experience to ensure all students feel empowered. Assessments are personalised and discussed from 
            the first session, avoiding rigid structures that might hinder progress. With a BA(Hons) in Creative Musicianship; 
            a Level 3 Diploma in Music Performance; and extensive experience as a freelance musician, I bring both 
            technical expertise and real-world insights to my teaching. In summary, my lessons are designed to help you 
            achieve your musical goals in a dynamic and engaging way.  
            <br><br>
            In addition to a strong focus on music production, my lessons also incorporate insights from my 
            Level 2 Counselling Skills Diploma, ensuring a supportive and empathetic learning environment. 
            I am adept at understanding and addressing the emotional aspects of learning, which is crucial for 
            building confidence and fostering a positive atmosphere. My freelance experience extends beyond music 
            to include graphic design and video direction, allowing me to teach students about the visual and 
            promotional aspects of their music careers. This holistic approach prepares students for the 
            multifaceted demands of the modern music industry.
