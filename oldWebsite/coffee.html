            <p class="why_coffee_text">
                My love for coffee began like mosts - keeping me awake during my studies!<br><br>
                But my enjoyment for coffee didn't end there. I began my experience with coffee brewing espresso. Fortunately, I have always worked 
                with independent coffee companies which kept me open to a range of different beans from a range of locations and farmers. This fed my 
                curiosity for getting more flavor out of the beans I had been working with and opened up the world of other brewing methods. Coming from 
                an english household I began with a cafetiere (French press) and soon purchased my own V60. And so began my specialty coffee journey.<br><br>
                Since then I have had barista, brewing and sensory training with
